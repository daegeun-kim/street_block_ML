# street_block_ML
Machine Learning project for analyzing shape features of street block of top 10 US cities
project detail: https://daegeunkim.com/streetblock.html

The analysis of street block shape was conducted on 4 different features of block shape:
- Area
- Isoperimetric Quotient
- Rectangularity
- Solidity

to predict:
- population
- urbanity
of each street block

through:
- exponential regression (for population prediction)
- logistic regression (for urbanity classification)
